# YQBoots Project Initializer - One Excel, One J2EE Project
The Project Initializer generates J2EE projects with Thymeleaf, Spring Boot and Boostrap in semi-automated mode. 
Some one may ask why not fully automated? This is because the project in real world may change quickly, I think the fully automated will be the constraints when business grows, so keep it thin to respond to the changes.
